# Telephone Churn Prediction 📞🔍

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) or stay with a telephone service provider based on given features. The classification model is built using machine learning techniques.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used is the **Telephone Dataset**, which is included in this repository.
- It contains various customer attributes that help in predicting churn status.

## 🎯 Objective
- To classify customers into **Churn = True** or **Churn = False** using relevant customer features.
- Identify key factors influencing customer churn.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for model building)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experimentation)

## 📊 Machine Learning Approach
- **Supervised Learning - Classification**
- Model Selection & Evaluation:
    - various classification algorithms vere tested
